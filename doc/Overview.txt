Standalone preforking PHP application server
--------------------------------------------



Overview
========



Framework consists of #FIXME main elements:
1. Parent                (A2o_AppSrv class)
2. CLI process part      (A2o_AppSrv_Cli class)
3. Master process part   (A2o_AppSrv_Master class)
4. Worker process part   (A2o_AppSrv_Worker class)
5. IPC part              (A2o_AppSrv_IPC class)
6. Client part(s)        (A2o_AppSrv_Client(_*) classes)

CLI, master and workers communicate to the Parent via "parent" object property,
which is assigned when instantiating an object via constructor.




Method naming convention
------------------------

Methods that DO NOT start with underscore prefix are public methods and can be:
- accessed from anywhere
- overriden by extending the class.

Methods that start with a single underscore prefix:
- are protected methods,
- can be overriden by extending the class,
- are intended to be accessed from user functions.

Methods that start with double underscore prefix:
- are public in the context of A2o_AppSrv inner workings,
- could be called from anywhere within A2o_AppSrv,
- not intended for final public use.
Example:

    $this->_parent->__registerMe_asWorker();

This registers the given process as a worker process. These methods should not 
be overriden. Obviously internal methods __construct() and __destruct() do 
not follow this rule as they are PHP internals.

Methods that start with triple underscore prefix:
- are private to a single class,
- should not be overriden.




Requirements
------------

The following programs and PHP modules/extensions are required:
- BASH or compatible shell
- ps
- grep
- sed
- PHP >=5.2.x
- PHP extension: pcntl
- PHP extension: posix
- PHP extension: sockets




How program executes and works
------------------------------
1. It all starts with A2o_AppSrv class method run()
- inits log and debug subsystems
- goes to CLI option processing
- merges ini and CMDLINE options
- surrenders execution to A2o_AppSrv_Master->__run()
- if master returns from execution, it is a child and thus goes to A2o_AppSrv_Master->run()

2. Log and debug part TODO
3. CLI part TODO
4. Option merging TODO
5. Master part TODO
6. Worker part TODO
