Usage examples
--------------
There are a couple of examples in the examples/ directory. To make them work as 
fast as possible, create a symlink like this:

    /opt/daemons/A2o/AppSrv ----> /exact/location/of/PHP-application-server

Then cd into a desired example directory and start daemon with:

    ./demo -d5

This does not fork daemon in the background so you can see what is going on in 
your console. If demo also provides a client, you can start it with:

    ./client

Otherwise you should use telnet as a sample client, like this:

    telnet localhost 30000
