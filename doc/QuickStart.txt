QuickStart quide for the impatient
==================================



To get the application server DEMO PROGRAM running as fast as possible, 
you have to do the following:

1. Review the Requirements.txt file in the "doc/" directory
2. Copy the whole folder to "/opt/daemons/AppSrv" folder, like this:

		$ cd PATH    (where this github package is, cd to the root of it)
		$ mkdir /opt/daemons/AppSrv
		$ cp * /opt/daemons/AppSrv

3. Start it by running "demo" program, like this:

		$ ./demo


4. Access the application server by telneting to port 30000 of localhost, like this:

		$ telnet localhost 30000
		
	or access it with a browser by this URI:
		
		http://localhost:30000/

5. That is it!
