Standalone preforking PHP application server
--------------------------------------------



Overview
========



Framework consists of #FIXME main elements:
1. Parent                (A2o_AppSrv class)
2. CLI process part      (A2o_AppSrv_Cli class)
3. Master process part   (A2o_AppSrv_Master class)
4. Worker process part   (A2o_AppSrv_Worker class)
5. IPC part              (A2o_AppSrv_IPC class)
6. Client part(s)        (A2o_AppSrv_Client(_*) classes)

CLI, master and workers communicate to the Parent via "parent" object property,
which is assigned when instantiating an object via constructor.




Method naming convention
------------------------

Methods that DO NOT start with underscore prefix are public methods and can be:
- accessed from anywhere
- overriden by extending the class.

Methods that start with a single underscore prefix:
- are protected/private methods,
- can be overriden by extending the class,
- are intended to be accessed from user functions.

Methods that start with double underscore prefix:
- are public in the context of A2o_AppSrv inner workings,
- could be called from anywhere within A2o_AppSrv,
- not intended for final public use.
Example:

    $this->_parent->__registerMe_asWorker();

This registers the given process as a worker process. These methods should not 
be overriden. Obviously internal methods __construct() and __destruct() do 
not follow this rule as they are PHP internals.

Methods that start with triple underscore prefix:
- are private to a single class,
- should not be overriden.
